    <H1>Testing Git</H1>
    <p>After I added a new index.html and created a new repository in map one, I commited to Github. </p>
    <p>Then I made a second map and cloned the files to this map.</p>
    <p>Now I'm going to create a second branch and push it to Github.</p>

    <p>After merging, I added the "dev" branch in the first map. Now Im trying to push again to github.</p>
